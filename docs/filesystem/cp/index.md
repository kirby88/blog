# Implementing `cp` for sparse files (aKa files with holes)

I'm currently reading the book [Avanced Programming in the UNIX Environment](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Programming-UNIX-Environment-3rd/dp/0321637739/). Not only it's amazing and well written, but the authors added a lot of fun exercises to do.
One of them (exercise 4.3) is to write the `cp` command utility, but only for sparse files, or as the author calls them file with holes.

## What are files with holes?

### Create a file with a hole
